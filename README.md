## Student Grade Generator 
This programs checks a student's marks and returns the grade. THe input should be between 0 - 100 marks.
The output is gradede as follows:
        A = 80 to 100
        B = 70 to 79
        C = 60 to 69
        D = 50 to 59
        E = 40 to 0 

   # How it works
- Once the page loads, a promt will appear that will promts the user to key in the marks. 
- Once the marks are keyed in, click `OK` and it will return the result based on the marks that were keyed in. 
- Refresh the page if you want to check another student's marks. 


# Speed Detector 
- This program takes the speed input as the car's speed e.g 100.
- If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

Example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

   # How it works
- Once the page loads, a promt will appear that will promts the user to input the speed. 
- Once the speed is keyed in, click `OK` and it will return the result based on the speed that were keyed in. 
- Refresh thepage if you want to check another driver's speed. 


# Net Salary Calculator
- This program has a major task that is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. It calculates the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary. 
- I used KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the links below;
